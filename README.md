CodeSignBreak
=============
This is a tool that patches XCode and your projects in order to let you install your apps on your `jailbreak` device whith `appsync` like [JailCoder](http://oneiros.altervista.org/jailcoder/) which not updates now(on 10.10 and XCode6 crashed).

# Requirements
## On your computer
The owner of Xcode cannot be `root`, i.e. you install Xcode by draging it from dmg to `/Applications`. As I know, the owner of app installed by Appstore will be root. You can change it by  `sudo chown -R userName /Applications/Xcode`
## On your device
1  jailbreak
2. [appsync(not ppsync)](https://github.com/angelXwind/AppSync)

# Just for Testing now
