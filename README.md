CodeSignBreak
=============
This is a tool that patches Xcode and your projects in order to let you install your apps on your `jailbreak` device with `appsync` like [JailCoder](http://oneiros.altervista.org/jailcoder/) which not updates now(on 10.10 and XCode6 crashed).

# Requirements
## On your computer
It's not a good idea to elevate privileges in applications. There are two methods to install Xcode:
1. draging it from dmg to `/Applications`.
2. install from appstore.

The latter one installs the Xcode as `root`. Please change it by  
 ```zsh
 sudo chown -R userName /Applications/Xcode.app
 ```

## On your device
1. Jailbreak
2. [appsync(not ppsync)](https://github.com/angelXwind/AppSync)

# Just for Testing now
Xcode 6.1 with iOS8
